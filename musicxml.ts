 * Traditional key signatures are represented by the number
 * of flats and sharps, plus an optional mode for major/
 * minor/mode distinctions. Negative numbers are used for
 * flats and positive numbers for sharps, reflecting the
 * key's placement within the circle of fifths (hence the
 * element name). A cancel element indicates that the old
 * key signature should be cancelled before the new one
 * appears. This will always happen when changing to C major
 * or A minor and need not be specified then. The cancel
 * value matches the fifths value of the cancelled key
 * signature (e.g., a cancel of -2 will provide an explicit
 * cancellation for changing from B flat major to F major).
 * The optional location attribute indicates where a key
 * signature cancellation appears relative to a new key
 * signature: to the left, to the right, or before the barline
 * and to the left. It is left by default. For mid-measure key
 * elements, a cancel location of before-barline should be
 * treated like a cancel location of left.
 * 
 * Non-traditional key signatures can be represented using
 * the Humdrum/Scot concept of a list of altered tones.
 * The key-step and key-alter elements are represented the
 * same way as the step and alter elements are in the pitch
 * element in the note.mod file. The optional key-accidental
 * element is represented the same way as the accidental
 * element in the note.mod file. It is used for disambiguating
 * microtonal accidentals. The different element names
 * indicate the different meaning of altering notes in a scale
 * versus altering a sounding pitch.
 * 
 * Valid mode values include major, minor, dorian, phrygian,
 * lydian, mixolydian, aeolian, ionian, locrian, and none.
 * 
 * The optional number attribute refers to staff numbers,
 * from top to bottom on the system. If absent, the key
 * signature applies to all staves in the part.
 * The optional list of key-octave elements is used to specify
 * in which octave each element of the key signature appears.
 * The content specifies the octave value using the same
 * values as the display-octave element. The number attribute
 * is a positive integer that refers to the key signature
 * element in left-to-right order. If the cancel attribute is
 * set to yes, then this number refers to an element specified
 * by the cancel element. It is no by default.
 * 
 * Key signatures appear at the start of each system unless

 * The appearance element controls general graphical
 * settings for the music's final form appearance on a
 * printed page of display. This includes support
 * for line widths, definitions for note sizes, and standard
 * distances between notation elements, plus an extension
 * element for other aspects of appearance.
 * 
 * The line-width element indicates the width of a line type
 * in tenths. The type attribute defines what type of line is
 * being defined. Values include beam, bracket, dashes,
 * enclosure, ending, extend, heavy barline, leger,
 * light barline, octave shift, pedal, slur middle, slur tip,
 * staff, stem, tie middle, tie tip, tuplet bracket, and
 * wedge. The text content is expressed in tenths.
 * 
 * The note-size element indicates the percentage of the
 * regular note size to use for notes with a cue and large
 * size as defined in the type element. The grace type is
 * used for notes of cue size that that include a grace
 * element. The cue type is used for all other notes with
 * cue size, whether defined explicitly or implicitly via a
 * cue element. The large type is used for notes of large
 * size. The text content represent the numeric percentage.
 * A value of 100 would be identical to the size of a regular
 * note as defined by the music font.
 * 
 * The distance element represents standard distances between
 * notation elements in tenths. The type attribute defines what
 * type of distance is being defined. Values include hyphen
 * (for hyphens in lyrics) and beam.
 * 
 * The other-appearance element is used to define any
 * graphical settings not yet in the current version of the
 * MusicXML format. This allows extended representation,
 * though without application interoperability.

 * time of compiling a sound (MIDI) file.
 * 
 * Dynamics (or MIDI velocity) are expressed as a percentage

 * 
 * Dacapo indicates to go back to the beginning of the
 * movement. When used it always has the value "yes".
 * 
 * Segno and dalsegno are used for backwards jumps to a
 * segno sign; coda and tocoda are used for forward jumps
 * to a coda sign. If there are multiple jumps, the value
 * of these parameters can be used to name and distinguish
 * them. If segno or coda is used, the divisions attribute
 * can also be used to indicate the number of divisions
 * per quarter note. Otherwise sound and MIDI generating
 * programs may have to recompute this.
 * 
 * By default, a dalsegno or dacapo attribute indicates that
 * the jump should occur the first time through, while a
 * tocoda attribute indicates the jump should occur the second
 * time through. The time that jumps occur can be changed by
 * using the time-only attribute.
 * 
 * Forward-repeat is used when a forward repeat sign is
 * implied, and usually follows a bar line. When used it
 * always has the value of "yes".
 * 
 * The fine attribute follows the final note or rest in a
 * movement with a da capo or dal segno direction. If numeric,
 * the value represents the actual duration of the final note or
 * rest, which can be ambiguous in written notation and
 * different among parts and voices. The value may also be
 * "yes" to indicate no change to the final duration.
 * 
 * If the sound element applies only particular times through a
 * repeat, the time-only attribute indicates which times to apply
 * the sound element. The value is a comma-separated list of
 * positive integers arranged in ascending order, indicating
 * which times through the repeated section that the element

 * both are present, the mid-instrument elements take
 * priority.
 * 
 * The damper-pedal, soft-pedal, and sostenuto-pedal
 * attributes effect playback of the three common piano
 * pedals and their MIDI controller equivalents. The yes
 * value indicates the pedal is depressed; no indicates
 * the pedal is released. A numeric value from 0 to 100

	 * For the enclosed shapes, the default is to be hollow for
	 * half notes and longer, and filled otherwise. The filled
	 * attribute can be set to change this if needed.
	 *
	 * If the parentheses attribute is set to yes, the notehead
	 * is parenthesized. It is no by default.
	 *
	 * The notehead-text element indicates text that is displayed
	 * inside a notehead, as is done in some educational music.
	 * It is not needed for the numbers used in tablature or jianpu
	 * notation. The presence of a TAB or jianpu clefs is sufficient
	 * to indicate that numbers are used. The display-text and

	 *
	 * Dynamics (or MIDI velocity) are expressed as a percentage
	 * of the default forte value (90 for MIDI 1.0).
	 *
	 * Dacapo indicates to go back to the beginning of the
	 * movement. When used it always has the value "yes".

	 * segno sign; coda and tocoda are used for forward jumps

	 * them. If segno or coda is used, the divisions attribute
	 * can also be used to indicate the number of divisions
	 * per quarter note. Otherwise sound and MIDI generating

	 * time through. The time that jumps occur can be changed by

	 * If the sound element applies only particular times through a

	 * both are present, the mid-instrument elements take
	 * priority.
	 *
	 * The damper-pedal, soft-pedal, and sostenuto-pedal
	 * attributes effect playback of the three common piano
	 * pedals and their MIDI controller equivalents. The yes
	 * value indicates the pedal is depressed; no indicates
	 * the pedal is released. A numeric value from 0 to 100
	 * may also be used for half pedaling. This value is the
	 * percentage that the pedal is depressed. A value of 0 is

	 * element is a child of a direction element, the sound offset
	 * element overrides the direction offset element if both
